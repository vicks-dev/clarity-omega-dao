# OmegaDAO

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) platform for scientific research funding built on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview
OmegaDAO enables decentralized funding of scientific research projects through a democratic proposal and voting system. Researchers can submit funding proposals, and token holders can vote on which projects to fund.

## Features
- Proposal submission system for research projects
- Token-weighted voting mechanism
- Treasury management for research funding
- Membership management through DAO tokens
- Milestone-based funding distribution

## How it Works
1. Researchers submit proposals with detailed research plans and funding requirements
2. DAO members review and vote on proposals using their governance tokens
3. Approved proposals receive funding in milestone-based installments
4. Progress is tracked and verified by DAO members
